# Customer Churn Prediction ðŸ’¼

## Overview

This repository contains code for predicting customer churn in a subscription-based service using a Logistic Regression algorithm. The project involves data preprocessing, visualization, and model training for predicting customer churn.

## Project Description ðŸ“‹

- **Data Loading:** The dataset, named 'Churn_Modelling.csv,' is loaded using the Pandas library to perform data analysis and modeling.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Irrelevant columns, such as 'RowNumber,' 'CustomerId,' and 'Surname,' are dropped to focus on relevant features. Categorical variables, 'Geography' and 'Gender,' are encoded into numerical values, and dummy variable trap is avoided by setting 'drop_first=True' when creating dummy variables.

- **Data Visualization:** Data visualization is performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to gain insights into the dataset. Bar charts are created to visualize the distribution of customers by 'Geography' and 'Gender.'

- **Feature Scaling:** Features are standardized using StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure that they have the same scale before model training.

- **Model Training:** A Logistic Regression model is trained on the entire dataset for customer churn prediction.

- **Churn Prediction for Specific Customers:** A function is implemented to predict churn for a specific customer using the trained model. The user can input a 'CustomerID' to receive a prediction and churn probability.

- **Model Evaluation:** Model evaluation is performed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for Logistic Regression. Additional evaluation for other machine learning algorithms can be added as needed.

## Usage ðŸš€

To use this code for customer churn prediction, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn).
3. Replace 'Churn_Modelling.csv' with your own dataset or use the provided dataset.
4. Run the code to perform data preprocessing, train the model, and predict churn for specific customers.

## Future Improvements ðŸ”§

- Extend model evaluation by implementing other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and comparing their performance.
- Improve data visualization by creating additional plots and charts to explore relationships and patterns in the data.
- Enhance the user interface for predicting churn for specific customers.
